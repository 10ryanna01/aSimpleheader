# aSimpleheader
build a simple responsive header


my approach: generate a quick prototype deployable workflow using yoeman web app generator @ https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp

why? for speed and simplicity. 
Alternatively just a codepen mockup would suffice, although i wanted to demonstrate my typical rapid prototyping workflow.

Considerations: BEM Sass, whilst relying on self documenting bootstrap grid classes for layout mobile viewports. Using as much natural flow from the framework as possible. Styling smaller atomic components with BEM for self documenting maintenance


How much time did you burn on this? Around 2hrs. 
Plugging away at sketch's compiled out design sort of sucks you in. #goodies

Other things worth adding: js/CSS animation library for more engaging content experience across devices.
